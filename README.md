Custom Trivia 

This game should be run on Google Chrome. There are 3 rounds of questions, and team scores are cumulative. This game was built to allow for a high level of customization so that the user can use this website for any type of event - from boardgame nights to studying, or even work team-bonding events.

Technologies Used:
-HTML
-CSS
-Javascript

Approach taken
-Custom Trivia was built to be highly customizable. For example: the logic loops through the list of teams rather than being hardcoded to switch back and forth between two teams. This makes it easier to implement a future feature to include more than 2 teams


Future Updates:
-Backend
-Ability to import questions with an Excel file
-Ability have have up to 10 teams
